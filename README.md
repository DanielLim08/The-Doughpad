I have just recently started with Fusion360, and have never interacted with KiCAD or firmware before, so most of this design process was pretty new to me! However, I found it a great first project (both in terms of KiCAD and Fusion), and a great way for me to familiarize myself with both KiCAD and Fusion360.
