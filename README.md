# The-Doughpad
This is a 8 key macropad with a rotary encoder. I wanted to have a lot of macros, hence the increased key number, along with the rotary encoder for additional versatility when assigning macros.
# Features
EC11 Rotary encoder 
2 WS2812B RGB LEDs
8 Keys
1 Case

I have just recently started with Fusion360, and have never interacted with KiCAD or firmware before, so most of this design process was pretty new to me! However, I found it a great first project (both in terms of KiCAD and Fusion), and a great way for me to familiarize myself with both KiCAD and Fusion360.

# IMAGES:
!!! PLEASE REFERENCE THE IMAGES FOLDER FOR SCREENSHOTS OF MY CAD AND PCB DESIGN !!!

# CAD Model:
I made my CAD model in Fusion360, and it has a basic top and bottom for the macropad. Everything fits inside the top and bottom case parts.

# PCB Design:
I designed my PCB on KiCAD. 

# Firmware:
I used KMK for my firmware.
The rotary encoder changes volume, and each of the 8 keys has a specific function, some were just there from the original code, while others I added because I thought that they would be useful. (COPY & PASTE).
